# Deep Learning for Radio Channel Modeling

This repository demonstrates the use of deep learning models (CNN, U-Net, GAN) for radio channel modeling, focusing on UAV-assisted 5G and mmWave networks. The aim is to provide learners and researchers with state-of-the-art implementations and tutorials for predicting path loss, visualizing radio environments, and generating synthetic channel data.

**Note:** This is a **work in progress** and will be updated regularly with new models, datasets, and tutorials. Stay tuned for more!
## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Tools for cleaning, augmenting, and visualizing radio channel data.
- **Multiple Models**: Implementations of CNN, U-Net, and GAN models for different radio network tasks.
- **Interactive Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks to walk through training, visualization, and fine-tuning models.
- **Results**: Visual outputs such as heatmaps, signal strength plots, and predictions over terrain.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
